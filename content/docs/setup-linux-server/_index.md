This guide will walk you through the steps to install a **Half-Life** server on any Linux distribution. Whether you're using **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Fedora**, **Arch**, or another distro, you’ll find everything you need to get your server up and running.

It’s assumed that you have terminal access to a server, typically rented from a provider such as **DigitalOcean**, **Vultr**, **OVH**, or similar hosting services. This setup serves as an alternative to renting pre-configured game servers with management panels, which are often more expensive and less flexible for customization.  

Familiarity with basic Linux commands and terminal operations is recommended, as it will help you address potential issues or revert changes during the setup process.

Let’s dive in and get your AG server ready to host games!
